# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This guide covers the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) setup for the PiHR Playwright automation project using GitHub Actions.

## üöÄ CI/CD Overview

### Benefits
- **Automated Testing**: Tests run automatically on code changes
- **Quality Gates**: Ensures code quality before deployment
- **Fast Feedback**: Quick identification of issues
- **Consistent Environment**: Same testing environment across all stages
- **Deployment Automation**: Automated deployment to staging and production

## üìã Pipeline Structure

### CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
1. **Lint and Validate**: Code quality checks
2. **Unit Tests**: Fast unit test execution
3. **Integration Tests**: Cross-browser testing
4. **BDD Tests**: Behavior-driven tests
5. **TDD Tests**: Test-driven development tests
6. **Allure Tests**: Comprehensive reporting

## üöÄ Local Development

### Running CI Locally
```bash
# Install act (GitHub Actions runner)
brew install act

# Run CI workflow locally
act push

# Run specific job
act -j integration-tests
```

### Testing Workflows
```bash
# Validate workflow syntax
act --list

# Dry run workflow
act --dryrun
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**
   ```bash
   # Fix file permissions
   chmod +x .github/workflows/*.yml
   ```

2. **Docker Build Failures**
   ```bash
   # Check Docker context
   docker build --no-cache .
   ```

3. **Test Failures**
   ```bash
   # Run tests locally first
   npm test
   npm run bdd
   npm run tdd
   ```

4. **Artifact Upload Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check artifact paths
   ls -la test-results/
   ls -la allure-results/
   ```

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check workflow syntax
yamllint .github/workflows/*.yml

# Validate GitHub Actions

## üîí Security Considerations

### Secrets Management
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Limit secret access to necessary workflows

### Security Scanning
- Regular dependency vulnerability scans
- Container security scanning
- Code security analysis

### Access Control
- Limit workflow permissions
- Use least privilege principle
- Monitor workflow access

This CI/CD setup provides a robust, automated pipeline for testing and deploying the PiHR Playwright automation project with proper quality gates, security checks, and deployment automation.
